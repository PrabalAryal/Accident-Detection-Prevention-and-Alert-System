# Accident-Detection-Prevention-and-Alert-System
project involving the use of ARDUINO-UNO microcontroller

Accident Detection and Alert System is designed to reduce accident fatalities. This system prioritizes the real-time detection and alerts of the accident
to the emergency service provider so that many lives can be saved.
This system comprises various sensors that ensure the safety of the driver, passengers, and other vehicles on the road. The first is an MQ3 gas sensor that 
continuously measures the driver's breath for the presence of alcohol vapor. If it detects levels beyond the set threshold, it triggers the relay to stop the
vehicle. The second sensor is a MEAS vibration sensor that monitors the vibrations felt by the vehicle. If it senses excessive vibrations beyond the threshold
level, it instantly cuts the power supply to the engine and triggers the documentation process. The system also includes a sensor that continuously monitors the 
orientation of the vehicle. If it detects the vehicle's orientation to be beyond the set threshold, it alerts the predefined contact number. Additionally, the 
system features an Eye Blink sensor that detects drowsiness in the driver. If the driver is asleep, the sensor triggers a buzzer to alert them before stopping
the vehicle. In the event of an accident, the system sends information about the accident along with the geo-location to the predefined contact number.
